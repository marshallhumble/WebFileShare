### Purpose 

This project came about from a need at work. We wanted to find an easy and secure way to share files with other people outside our organization. 

### Status

This is current a work in progress, at the moment I have it setup so that it can upload files and email users of the new file. Users can sign up, login/logout/update profiles. There is also an admin user that can admin the users. Middleware is configured, and various security controls are in place. 

### Next Steps

1. Create a unique link for downloading of files and clean up homepage
2. Add in admin for all files
3. Finish/Add more tests on new features
